 * 3. Sets the entry date's time to the start of the day (UTC) for consistent daily tracking.
 * 4. Retrieves the user's daily water goal and ID from the request's user object.
 * 5. Constructs the parameters and update object for the database query, ensuring the entry date and daily water goal are set on insert.
 * 6. Sets the options for the database operation to return the new document, upsert, and run validators.
 * 7. Calls the water service to find, create, or update the water record with the given parameters.
 * 8. Calculates the new total water percentage based on the added intake and the daily goal.
 * 9. Constructs the payload with the new intake amount, consumed time, and water percentage.
 * 10. Adds the water intake to the user's record and retrieves the updated document.
 * 11. Sends a response with the new daily water record.
